# Thesis
This repository contains my R and Python scripts for my thesis

-The R file contains some data cleaning and almost all analyses.

-"Scraping_Script.py" web scrapes my server on Survey Solutions to extract information from one of my questions.

-"Cleaning job.py" cleans up the variable in my data that records occupation, categorizing into no job, ranch job, or other job.

-"Geographic data.py" cleans all the geographic questions in my data, yielding a dataframe that can be put into ArcGIS to make a map.
